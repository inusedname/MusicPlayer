AI agents must follow these rules while working on the project:
1. When something is uncertain, unambiguous, for example a 3rd party library has breaking change in major version, or user does not provide a step by step instruction in any case excepts on Chat mode, do not hallucinate and ask user to provide detail or decision

2. Think step by step before process.
